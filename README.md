### Yandex Practicum / Sprint #5 - Exploratory Data Analysis

*Project Description*

We have access to the Yandex Real Estate service data - an archive of apartment sale ads in St. Petersburg and neighboring towns for several years. The task is to preprocess the data and study them to find interesting features and dependencies that exist in the real estate market. There are two types of data for each apartment in the database: user-added and cartographic. For example, the first type includes the apartment's area, floor, and the number of balconies, while the second type includes distances to the city center, airport, and nearest park.
